## Hi there ðŸ™Œ I am a fullstack software engineer.
I am a dedicated full stack software engineer having specialized skillset in frontend development.
I have great experience in building industrial web applications from groundup to the production in different industries including healthcare, internet marketing, entertainment and blockchain/web3.

My favorite development toolkit includes Javascript, Typescript, React, Next.js, TailwindCSS and NestJS/AWS Lambda (for backend). The DeadHeads and Rooniverse in my portfolio are dapps that I built recently using these frameworks.

I ensure the highest quality of the product by following the best convention and practices and by implementing modern-looking user interfaces and best user experiences.

## I have great experience in implementing the following features on frontend:
    - Creating pixel-perfect and responsive layout from Figma/XD designs
    - Creating scalable architecture and reusable components on frontend
    - Integrating backend APIs through Axios/GraphQL libraries
    - Implementing sophisticated state management mechanism by using Redux and React Context APIs
    - Adding authentication /authorization layer and mechanism by using JWT/OAuth/Auth0/AWS Cognito
    - Building intuitive admin dashboard for managing/monitoring the application statuses and states with different types charts, tables and rich components
    - Configuring CI/CD of frontend on Netlify, Vercel, Digital Ocean and AWS Amplify

## The major languages/frameworks that I am best at:
    - ES5/ES6, TypeScript, SCSS, CSS3, TailwindCSS, HeadlessUI
    - React/Redux/React Hooks/Material-UI/Next.js/Gatsby/React Bootstrap/Storybook
    - Vue2/Vue3/Vuex/Vue-Router/Vuetify/Nuxt.js
    - Jest/React Testing Library/Cypress/Mocha
    - REST/GraphQL/Axios
    - OAuth2/JWT/Auth0/AWS Cognito
    - Figma/Adobe XD

## I have pretty good experience in backend development  also including the following languages/frameworks:
    - Serverless/Python/Node.js
    - Express.js/Nest.js/FastAPI/Django/Laravel
    - AWS/AWS Amplify/AWS SAM/AWS Lambda
    - MySQL/PostgreSQL/AWS RDS & Data API/AWS DynamoDB
    - Stripe/Plaid/SendGrid Integrations

I have specialized experience in using/integrating AWS services and building backend APIs using AWS Lambda and serverless architecture.

I am very much familiar with agile development tools and environments including:
    - Managing source code through GIT, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and following GIT flow in development
    - Task tracking and progress reporting through JIRA, Trello and GitHub Issues
    - Following the SCRUM/Sprint principles and attending daily meeting for team collaboration and discussion

I have been working in remote teams the last 6 years and I am a good team player.
I am good at balancing quality and productivity.

I hope we can discuss further on the call if you are interested in my skillset and experience.
Thank you very much for reviewing my proposal!
